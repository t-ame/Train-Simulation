# MARTA Train ridership Simulation

#### `This was a group project with each group member contributing to every aspect of the code`

- The [Official documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TQnV_xkNiqZVAdHiBxkUaKbdTB2uMdcEr8sbEM-rQeg/edit?usp=sharing) contains better expllanation of the design concept, logic and algorithm.

### Brief overview
Simulation of MARTA train passenger load, taking into consideration the train line, the time of day, and event locations during the day.
It outputs summarized or detailed(verbose) information on the number of passengers on the train at each station, considering the distance of the station from the central station and the proximity of the station to an event occuring. it receives input from the user with which the simulation is cutomized.
